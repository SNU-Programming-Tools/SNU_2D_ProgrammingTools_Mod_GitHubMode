# README - For GistHub mode

This is the GistHub mode section of SNU. It was added to this module on August 5th 2020, starting development the same day (August 5th 2020) it was considered for a while if this should be a separate repository or not, I decided to keep it part of the programming tools module. I will export it in the future if necessary.

SNU has modes that are meant to emulate other sites by making an open-source, feature full remake. This mode is for gist.github.com

This sub-sub-module is in very early development and is **far** from complete. You can help by contributing to it. Note that sub-modules and sub-sub-modules follow the same contributing rules of the main module when not provided.

I call gist.github.com GistHub. That is why it has this name.
